    A graduate student in the field of Soft Matter Physics at [Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata](http://iacs.res.in/), particularly interested in hard particle self-assembly and equally involved in capturing stunning photographs as passion. My interests in Physics share a huge intersection region with Classical Statistical Mechanics and Condensed matter Physics.
